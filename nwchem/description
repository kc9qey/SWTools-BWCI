<h2>Description</h2>

<p>NWChem is a computational chemistry package that is designed to run on 
high-performance parallel supercomputers as well as conventional workstation 
clusters. It aims to be scalable both in its ability to treat large problems 
efficiently, and in its usage of available parallel computing resources. NWChem 
has been developed by the Molecular Sciences Software group of the 
Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) at the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory (PNNL). Most of the implementation has been funded by the 
EMSL Construction Project. <a

Page</a>. 
 
<h2>Use</h2>

<p> In order to use NWChem, the following environment variables should be 
properly set:

<ul>
<li>$NWCHEM_BASIS_LIBRARY, must point the binary toward the location for the 
basis set library when doing abi initio electronic structure calculations.
<li>$HOME_NWCHEMRC, points the binary toward the location of a file named 
.nwchemrc.
<li>$NWCHEM_NWPW_LIBRARY, must point the binary toward the location for the 
basis set library when doing sudopotential calculations.
</ul> 

<p>These three variables are automatically set in the nwchem module.</p>

<pre>
module load nwchem

aprun -n [number of cores] -S [number of cores per Socket] nwchem [input file] 
> [output file]
