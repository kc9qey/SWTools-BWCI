Installing v15May15 required to change the rebuild script since some things are different. I had to disable two modules QUIP and PYTHON to get it to compile. QUIP needs to be downloaded manually and I prefered not to.
NOTE: The code seems it does not to be modified anymore as Reuben had done iit in the past. 


1. The following packages in LAMMPS are disabled because they either depends on
more external libraries, irrelevant to Darter (e.g. GPU, CUDA), or seemed to
be causing trouble:

make no-gpu
make no-kim
make no-voronoi
make no-user-atc
make no-user-awpmd
make no-user-cuda
make no-user-molfile

2. This version of lammps (1Feb14) contains bugs that causes compilation to
fail with:
./pair_adp_omp.cpp(203): error: class "LAMMPS_NS::ThrData" has no member
"timer"
      thr->timer(Timer::PAIR);
           ^
../pair_adp_omp.cpp(203): error: incomplete type is not allowed
      thr->timer(Timer::PAIR);

../pair_adp_omp.cpp(221): error: class "LAMMPS_NS::ThrData" has no member
"timer"
      thr->timer(Timer::PAIR);
           ^
../pair_adp_omp.cpp(221): error: incomplete type is not allowed
      thr->timer(Timer::PAIR);

The solution is just to delete those two lines. This is done in rebuild
script. See also: http://lammps.sandia.gov/threads/msg41047.html

Future version may fix this, and thus rebuild script needs to be adjusted to
remove the line deletion (line 131 in rebuild).
