Comments on NAMD 2.10b1 on Cray XC (Reuben Budiardja, 2014-10-02)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NAMD 2.10b1 provides config for Cray XC with Intel compiler only as:
"./config CRAY-XC-intel". However upon testing the GNU build is still 
faster than the Intel build, therefore it's the one used. Intel build is
left as reference. In the GNU build the config is still 
"./config CRAY-XT-g++" but this is just a name; Don't be confuse with the XT
reference, it means nothing since CHARM++ used for the parallelization
correctly uses crayxc profile. 


Build Notes for NAMD 2.9 on Cray XE (Reuben Budiardja, 2014-01-30)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is needed to build NAMD 2.9 correctly (avoiding seg faults)
on XE with Cray's Jan 2014 PE Release, GCC 4.8.2

1. Untar TCL 8.5.9, apply the CrayXE patch for 8.5.9 to avoid getpwuid
during initialization (this causes segfault, see 
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/mailing_list/namd-l.2010-2011/3577.html)
The patch is in /sw/sources/namd/2.9 directory, and can be downloaded again
from the following if necessary
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/libraries/tcl8.5.9-crayxe-tclUnixInit.patch

1b. Do not set CC=cc for building TCL. You'll get errors with incompatible
memcpy, etc. Build it with 'gcc' instead (set CC=gcc)

2. When building charm++, don't use "--with-production" flag. For some
reason this flag causes crashes of charm++ with this version of NAMD
Build Charm++ with:
./build charm++ mpi-crayxe --no-build-shared

3. Don't specify --cxx and --cc flag in the config line of NAMD as they
causes seg fault (not sure why). Use the following:

./config CRAY-XT-g++ --with-tcl --tcl-prefix $SW_BLDDIR \
--with-fftw3  --fftw-prefix $CRAY_FFTW_DIR/interlagos \
--charm-base ${SW_BLDDIR}/${NAMD_SRCDIR}/${CHARM_SRCDIR} \
--charm-arch mpi-crayxe

All of these are embodied in the rebuild script, and documented here for
future references.
