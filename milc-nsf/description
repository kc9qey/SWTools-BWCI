<h2>Description</h2>

<p> The benchmark code MILC represents part of a set of codes written by the
MIMD Lattice Computation (MILC) collaboratoration used to study quantum
chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interactions of subatomic
physics. It performs simulations of four dimensional SU(3) lattice gauge
theory on MIMD parallel machines. "Strong interactions" are responsible for
binding quarks into protons and neutrons and holding them all together in the
atomic nucleus.
